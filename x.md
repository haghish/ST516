#### A Repository for ST516 Course - Computational Statistics

Hi Folks!

This is a repository for the **Computational Statistics** class, in *Spring, 2016*. We will be doing a lot of activities here. 
Run experiments, share code, exercises, ..., and [Shiny Applications](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), like those I use in the class for simulating experiments. 
Once you have solved the exercises, push your codes and files. It'd be so nice if you do them using 
[rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). But simple R script files would be as good.


> Note that this repository is not meant to replace **Blackboard Platform**. This is just a repository for the whole class to 
practice GitHub, cooperate on group assignments, and share the exercises with the rest of the class ;)
